This app provides a generic taxonomy model where you can create any types
of taxonomy you want.  This is handled by TaxonomyGroup, TaxonomyItem,
TaxonomyMember, and TaxonomyMap objects.

Any model can be mapped to any taxonomy you want with no changes to
the database tables required for existing models.

Models:
TaxonomyGroup:
        This is what you are naming your class of taxonomy.  It could be tags,
        categories, types of animals, anything you want to call it and have it
        represent.

TaxonomyItem:
        These represent a specific classifcation within a TaxonomyGroup.
        If your TaxonomyGroup is "types of animals" then this would probably
        contains items such as "dog", "cat", "elephant", "dragon", etc.

TaxonomyMap:
        This maps your objects to a TaxonomyItem.  There are shortcuts built
        into the classes so that these objects rarely need touched and do
        their work behind the scenes.

TaxonomyMember:
        This is an abstract base class.  It does not create a database table
        and does not currently define any fields.  It just provides a couple of
        helpful methods for the models to interract with the taxonomy app.

Admin:
A TaxonomyMapInline is provided which can be used as an inline for any models.
This inline allows taxonomies to be set on the models directly when editing them
in their own admin.  This way there is no need to go into the TaxonomyMap admin
which is a bit of a hassle to use due to needing to know.  It does not currently
let you filter out by specific TaxonomyGroup, but it should in the future.
